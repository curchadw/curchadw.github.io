This might not apply to everyone but many will be able to relate.

What are my top five reasons to learn coding?

1. It's a challenge that I want to ovecome
2. I can go anywhere to code
3. Coding can help change your situation finacially. 
4. The complexity makes you curious once you are drawn in
5. There are so many things you can do that lead to other things

I will admit...I've been a very inconsistent individual when it comes to learning to code, but I do not have the right guidance. There are some people that can pick this up and run with it, and then there is people like that need the guidance. I'm not saying that I will not succeed, but I rather succeed with the right team team. Is this a challenge Yes it is, but can I overcome it....I will

The world is my playground, and I plan to play in it. One of the advantages of coding is you can do it from anywhere due to the resources available that it happen. At one point all you could do is go to an office at your job and just code there. Thanks to resources like github, slack,  zoom, and vpn, you can work completely virtually, but of course it depends on your job.

Getting into the coding industry can change lives finacially. I've been a bartender for over years now, and I want to do something different. I got my degeree in Computer Science in 2010 and I'm still feel like I'm in limbo. My life could have been different if I tooks things serious. That's my sob story and nobody else should make the same mistakes as me if the oppurtunity is right there in front of them. If you are exploring this path, I think its worth it. Getting into coding can help stablize people's financial situations if they are responsible. There are many oppertunities whether its freelance, corporation, or both. The world in changing and coding has become a invaluable skill.

The complexity of coding will keep you always curious on how things work behind a program or web application.  It will cause you to thank about things from an objecitve level when trying to get something for work. There is a whole lot of trial and error involved, and it becomes frustrating. That's the beauty of coding, it challenges you all the time. There are many ways to do one thing in coding. You can even do some of the must simple things in a very complex way. If you are the type of person that overthinks, coding mught be right for you.

The thing about getting into coding is it paves the way to other things to do in IT. With the field of IT being so vast I cannot really go into details. But all I can say is when I look at a lot of these job descriptions, it helps to have a developer background as it shows that you have a systematic approach on addressing a problem and solving it.
